## Subsystem Split

The workload for Project Firesight was divided into four subsystems that will be distributed evenly amongst the four teammates. These four subsystems are Mechanical Casing/Structures (including the underground feature) & Microcontroller, ESP-NOW Communication, Power Supply, and Control Panel. The sensor subsystem was removed due to the responsible teammate withdrawing from the course. As such, an already built BME280 breakout board was used in replacement. The weather stations will be communicating with the main control panel continuously. 

## Idea Generation - Sort, Rank, Recombine, Group

The brainstorming process generated a total of 120 ideas. During the process, no idea was dismissed in order to encourage creative thinking. The ideas generated ranged from the type of sensors to use, how to use them, how the system will function, etc. The figure below depicts all of the ideas generated during this process.

Afterwards, the generated ideas were sorted based on similar themes. The themes chosen were Life Cycle, Sensors/Data, Structure/Ergonomics, Communication, Prevention, and Response. The figure below depicts all of the ideas after being sorted. The 'Life Cycle' grouping is not shown due to issues with image size.

The ideas were then ranked based on how feasible they are, which was determined by budget constraints, time constraints, and if they satisfied the stakeholder needs (durability, survivability, and wireless real-time data). The figure below depicts the ranked ideas, which have a 'fire' emoji on them.

Afterwards, the ranked ideas were improved upon, recombined, and finally grouped into our final product: a wireless weather station with a LED control panel, with an HMI screen attached as a stretch goal. The figure below depicts the final grouping.
