    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Relatively solder friendly                | Generates switching noise ripple                                 |
    | No heat sink required in some designs     | Limited to 1A output                                             |
    |                                           | Efficiency drops under light loads

    ![](power_2.png)

    * $1.43/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM7805MPX-NOPB/6110583)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | Very low noise output                                             | Poor efficiency at high voltages     |
    | Doesn't require many external components                          | Limited to 1A output                 |
    | Widely available and inexpensive                                  |

3. LM2596S-(5.0/3.3V)/NOPB Bucking Voltage Regulator

    ![](power_3.png)

    * $6.97/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM2596S-5-0-NOPB/334842)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | High efficiency at moderate to high current                       | Generates switching noise            |
    | Has a shutdown feature                                            | Feedback trace must be isolated      |
    | Widely used, readily available reference designs                  | May be difficult to solder           |

**Choice:** LM2596S-(5.0/3.3V)/NOPB Bucking Voltage Regulator

**Rationale:** The best choice is the LM2596S/NOPB for 5V output and 3.3V as it has a high efficiency at a much higher current load (3A), incorporates a shutdown feature, and is widely used with available reference designs. The high current load is better suited for our project as we will be using a small DC motor to close the underground PCB box in the event of extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, the shutdown feature can be used to turn off all critical components in the event that the underground PCB box must close.

    | Senses 3 data types                                               | More complex coding                  |

    | Widely available and inexpensive                                  |

3. SHT31-DIS-B2.5KS - Humidity & Temperature Sensor

    ![](sensor_3.png)

    * $4.01/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sensirion-ag/SHT31-DIS-B2-5KS/5872252?)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | Two distinctive, user selectable I2C addresses                    | Generates switching noise            |
    | Wide input voltage range                                          | Feedback trace must be isolated      |
    | NIST traceable measurements (industry standard)                   | May be difficult to solder           |

**Choice:** BME 280 - Humidity, Temperature, and Pressure Sensor

**Rationale:** The best choice for this subsystem is the BME 280 as it senses multiple variables within one package, which prevents I2C bus problems. The code is intensive, but an API library is available on github and the datasheet offers code examples to follow.  

## Subsystem 3: Control Panel 

*Table 3: Red LED Component Selection*

### Wildfire Susceptibilite Indicating LED

    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | Inexpensive                                                       | Vulnerable to thermal cycling        |
    | Compact                                                           | Difficult to solder                  |
    | Very bright for its size                                          |
