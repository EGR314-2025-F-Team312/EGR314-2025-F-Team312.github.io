    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Relatively solder friendly                | Generates switching noise ripple                                 |
    | No heat sink required in some designs     | Limited to 1A output                                             |
    |                                           | Efficiency drops under light loads

    * $1.43/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM7805MPX-NOPB/6110583)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | Very low noise output                                             | Poor efficiency at high voltages     |
    | Doesn't require many external components                          | Limited to 1A output                 |
    | Widely available and inexpensive                                  |

3. LM2596S-(5.0/3.3V)/NOPB Bucking Voltage Regulator

    ![](power_3.png)

    * $6.97/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM2596S-5-0-NOPB/334842)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | High efficiency at moderate to high current                       | Generates switching noise            |
    | Has a shutdown feature                                            | Feedback trace must be isolated      |
    | Widely used, readily available reference designs                  | May be difficult to solder           |

**Choice:** LM2596S-(5.0/3.3V)/NOPB Bucking Voltage Regulator

**Rationale:** The best choice is the LM2596S/NOPB for 5V output and 3.3V as it has a high efficiency at a much higher current load (3A), incorporates a shutdown feature, and is widely used with available reference designs. The high current load is better suited for our project as we will be using a small DC motor to close the underground PCB box in the event of extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, the shutdown feature can be used to turn off all critical components in the event that the underground PCB box must close.

## Subsystem 2: Sensors 

*Table 2: Sensor Component Selection*

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | Very low noise output                                             | Poor efficiency at high voltages     |

    | Widely available and inexpensive                                  |

3. SHT31-DIS-B2.5KS - Humidity & Temperature Sensor

    ![](sensor_3.png)

    * $4.01/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sensirion-ag/SHT31-DIS-B2-5KS/5872252?)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | Two distinctive, user selectable I2C addresses                    | Generates switching noise            |
    | Wide input voltage range                                          | Feedback trace must be isolated      |
    | NIST traceable measurements (industry standard)                   | May be difficult to solder           |

**Choice:** BME 280 - Humidity, Temperature, and Pressure Sensor

**Rationale:** The best choice for this subsystem is the BME 280 as it senses multiple variables within one package, which prevents I2C bus problems. The code is intensive, but an API library is available on github and the datasheet offers code examples to follow.  

## Subsystem 3: Control Panel 

*Table 3: Red LED Component Selection*

### Wildfire Susceptibilite Indicating LED

1. HLMP-Q150-F0011 Red LED

    ![](led_1.png)

    | Very bright for its size                                          |

3. APT2012SURCK LED

    ![](led_3.png)

    * $0.20/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/kingbright/APT2012SURCK/1747532)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | Low power consumption                                             | Difficult to solder                  |

    | Vibrant red, suitable for status indication                       |            

**Choice:** HLMP-Q150-F0011 Red LED

**Rationale:** Option 1 is the best choice for our design because itâ€™s the least fragile and easiest to manually solder of the 3. Furthermore, having the highest visibility possible is important for warning the user of wildfire susceptibility.

3. 150141RB73100 RGB LED

    ![](led_6.png)

    * $0.34/each
    * [Product Link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/w%C3%BCrth-elektronik/150141RB73100/4489963)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|
    | RGB LED                                                           | Thermal management complications     |
    | Compact                                                           | Requires multiple control channels   |
    | Vibrant red, suitable for status indication                       |            

**Choice:** ALMD-CB1E-VW002 Blue LED

**Rationale:** Option 2 is the best choice for sensor threshold indication (humidity, temperature, wind direction) because of its low power consumption and high visibility. Furthermore, the RGB function of option 3 would go unused, making the further subsystem design complications unnecessary.

## Subsystem 4: Mechanical Casing & Inner Casing Temperature 

*Table 5: Mechanical Casing Selection*

### Mechanical Casing

1. High-grade ABS material

    ![](casing_1.png)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                                 |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------|

**Choice:** High-grade ABS 

**Rationale:** The high-grade ABS will be the best material and composition as it is waterproof to help with groundwater. Furthermore, it already has a PCB mounting method and it is easy to drill into to add our external sensors. Some people would argue that this is not the best option because it is not fireproof. This problem is solved by burying the box at least 1 foot underground. This will keep our electronics safe in the event of a wildfire. It is also the cheapest option.

**Choice:** TC74A4-3.3VCTTR Temperature Sensor 

**Rationale:** The component we are going with is the TC74 because we have stock of this sensor and will not cost us to use. It will meet all the requirements needed for this sensor. If we did not have this sensor in stock the best option would be the SLTM20 due to it being the most resistant to high temperatures, has a better accuracy than the TC74, and is the cheapest unit.

**Choice:** TI DRV8838 Motor Driver 

**Rationale:** The best choice is the TI DRV8838 Motor Driver as it satisfies our basic project needs while having manageable cons compared to other choices. Even though it will require a heat plate to solder and needs good copper traces, these can be easily learned and implemented. In contrast, a motor driver that will shutdown at a consistent high load or use more MCU pins could lead to substantial issues. Furthermore, this motor driver has slightly more headroom on continuous current.

**Choice:** ESP-NOW 

**Rationale:** The best choice for wireless communication is ESP-NOW. Although it can only pair with up to 20 Espressif devices, our network topology only requires a single device to pair with four other ESP32s. Furthermore, the setup code is simpler compared to other communication protocols and has a lower latency, which is important for real-time wildfire prediction and detection.
