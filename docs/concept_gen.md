## Learning about Wildfire Response & Potential Stakeholders

The goal of our project is to provide a proactive approach to wildfire management and suppression. During the in-class stakeholder interview, the stakeholder spokesperson detailed that they only conduct a reactive approach to fighting wildfires; drones are only utilized to capture visual, thermal, and atmospheric details of an ongoing wildfire. Furthermore, the drones’ battery life only lasts for an hour, which limits the amount of data that can be collected. The spokesperson detailed that they receive predictive weather information from an outside organization, but did not describe how they process or utilize that information, or how long it takes for that information to be given. With the increasing unpredictability of weather phenomena, it is important that these extreme weather/environmental organizations have accurate, real-time data available. 

Thus, Project [name TBD] purpose is to create a wireless weather station network that will measure and transmit real-time weather data to a main control panel. Each weather station will measure atmospheric details, such as wind speed, air humidity, ground & air temperature, ground moisture, and more. This data will be sent to a primary control panel, which will have indicator LEDs to alert to the status of each weather station and indicate whether the area it is in is susceptible to wildfires. 

The audience for our project is both in academia and in industry. These stakeholders are our professor, Dr. Dajiang Suo, our teaching assistants, the State of Arizona’s Department of Forestry and Fire Management, local fire departments, local, state, and/or federal environmental agencies, environmental or wildlife research groups, and local residential communities. Our stakeholders can even extend to Arizona’s state government, as extreme wildfires can produce a domino effect of consequences that affect Arizona as a whole. 

## Idea Generation - Sort, Rank, Recombine, Group

The brainstorming process generated a total of 120 ideas. During the process, no idea was dismissed in order to encourage creative thinking. The ideas generated ranged from the type of sensors to use, how to use them, how the system will function, etc. The figure below depicts all of the ideas generated during this process.

Afterwards, the generated ideas were sorted based on similar themes. The themes chosen were Life Cycle, Sensors/Data, Structure/Ergonomics, Communication, Prevention, and Response
