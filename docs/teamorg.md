The team organization outlines team goals, team charter, and the product mission statement

## Team Goals

Team goals were determined through discussion, in which the common goals were highlighted and chosen. Below are a selection of the team goals common amongst all of the members. For a detailed list of all team goals, please see the Team Organization Appendix. 

- Create a product that allows our stakeholders to PROACTIVELY fight wildfires, particularly through multiple mini-weather stations that send data back to a control panel. 

- Successfully integrate wireless data communication into the final product

- Create at least **two mini weather stations** that successfully send data back to the control panel. 

- Accurately depict a wildfire susceptible area by using at least **three different sensors**

- Create a product that operates and runs successfully for at least **three months** while staying under the $300 budget

- Successfully integrate at least **five subsystems** with the main control panel

- Create a product that can withstand temperatures up to **1500 degrees Fahrenheit**

- Create a product that withstands wind gusts up to **120 miles per hour**

- Create a product that blends in with the evnironment to prevent wildlife engagement

- Create a product that does not interfere with the environment, ecosystem, or any local, state, and federal rules and regulations

These goals were determined by the information presented at the stakeholder interview, and was further refined during discussions in class and in team meetings. As the stakeholder conducts a reactive approach to fighting wildfires, Team [name TBD] is focused on developing a proactive approach. In this way, the stakeholder can predict potential wildfire spots before they happen, thereby increasing their wildfire detection efficiency.  

These goals will help Team [name TBD] in academia and in industry, as it further develops technical, project management, and teammwork skills, all of which are important in the work force and future academic pursuits. 

## Team Charter

The team charter is a summary statement of the project goals, which was determined after discussion with the stakeholders, professors & TA's, and internal team discussions.

Team [name TBD] will design and build a cost-effective mini weather station network for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Wildfire Management. The system will consist of at least two wireless, sensor-equipped stations integrated with a central control panel to identify wildfire-susceptible areas and support proactive suppression. Operating for at least three months on a $300 budget, the product will integrate at least five subsystems, withstand extreme conditions (1500Â°F, 120 mph winds), and remain environmentally compliant while blending into natural surroundings.

## Product Mission Statement

The product mission statement details the purpose and direction of Project [name TBD], which was determined through the discussion with the stakeholders, professors & TA's, and multiple internal team discussions. 

The mission of Project [name TBD] is to design, build, debug, and test a wireless weather station network for the State of Arizona's Department of Forestry and Wildfire Management, with the purpose of predicting susceptible widlfire areas to proactively improve wildfire detection & suppression, thereby decreasing wildfire suppression time.
