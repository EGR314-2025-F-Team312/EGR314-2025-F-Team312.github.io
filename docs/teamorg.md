The team organization outlines team goals, team charter, and the product mission statement

## Team Goals

Team goals were determined through discussion, in which the common goals were highlighted and chosen. Below are the team goals common amongst all of the members: 
- Further enhance the technical and project management skills developed in the previous course, EGR304
- Further enhance and develop a basic understanding of the product development process
- Gain an intermediary mastery of creating an electromechanical system
- Create a product that allows our stakeholders to PROACTIVELY fight wildfires, particularly through multiple mini-weather stations that send data back to a control panel. 
- Successfully integrate wireless data communication into the final product
- Create at least **two mini weather stations** that successfully send data back to the control panel. 
- Accurately depict a wildfire susceptible area by using at least **three different sensors**
- Create a product that operates and runs successfully for at least **three months** while staying under the $300 budget
- Successfully integrate at least **five subsystems** with the main control panel
- Create a product that can withstand temperatures up to **1500 degrees Fahrenheit**
- Create a product that withstands wind gusts up to **120 miles per hour**
- Create a product that does not interfere with the environment, ecosystem, or any local, state, and federal rules and regulations

These goals were determined by the information presented at the stakeholder interview, and was further refined during discussions in class and in team meetings. As the stakeholder conducts a reactive approach to fighting wildfires, Team [name TBD] is focused on developing a proactive approach. In this way, the stakeholder can predict potential wildfire spots before they happen, thereby increasing their wildfire detection efficiency.  

These goals will help Team [name TBD] in academia and in industry, as it further develops technical, project management, and teammwork skills, all of which are important in the work force and future academic pursuits. 

The team charter is a summary statement of the team's purpose and direction, which was determined after the main goals were defined.

## Team Charter

Throughout Project [name TBD], Team 312 will further enhance the technical, project management, and product development skills gained in EGR 304 by creating an electromechanical system in collaboration with an existing organization or company. 

## Product Mission Statement

The mission of the team throughout Project [name TBD] is to develop an electromechanical system for the State of Arizona's Department of Forestry and Fire Management, with the intent purpose of developing a proactive approach to managing and fighting wildfires.
